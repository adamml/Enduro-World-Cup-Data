# Enduro World Series / UCI MTB World Cup Enduro Battlemaps

## What is a battlemap?

From the [F1 Data Junkie](http://www.f1datajunkie.com/) blog, a battlemap in this context is a way of visualising the story of a race . There are some more posts by Tony Hirst on the development of the battlemaps and track concordance charts [here](https://blog.ouseful.info/2015/01/31/rediscovering-formula-one-race-battlemaps/) and [here](https://blog.ouseful.info/2017/05/01/track-concordance-charts/). There are also some great ideas, perhaps more suited to the Enduro side of things, at [Rally Data Junkie](https://rallydatajunkie.com/).

As much as I love motorsport, bicycle racing is more my cup of tea. And as much as I love the Enduro data deep dives on [Pink Bike](https://www.pinkbike.com/) (see [here](https://www.pinkbike.com/news/race-analysis-chatel-edr-world-cup-2023.html) for example), I've always thought that the graphics lacked a little something, especially in tying the whole race together in one visual.

So this repo tries to address that by taking the MTB Enduro data and putting it on those F1/WRC style graphs.
